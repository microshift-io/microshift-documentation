MicroShift is not on a regular release schedule.

You may view the release page [here](https://github.com/redhat-et/microshift/releases)

MicroShift is built from [OKD](https://www.okd.io/), the Kubernetes distribution by the OpenShift community. The OKD version currently used to build is `4.8.0-0.okd-2021-10-10-030117`

{{< warning >}}
MicroShift is still early days and moving fast. Features are missing. Things break. But you can still help shape it, too.
