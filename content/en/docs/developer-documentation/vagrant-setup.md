It is possible to use Vagrant for VM provisioning, however it is not necessary.

Find a guide on how to install it for your system [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads).

Once Vagrant is installed, create a Vagrant box for the operating
system of choice. For this example we will be looking at a [fedora 34 cloud
image](https://app.vagrantup.com/fedora/boxes/34-cloud-base), however you can substitute any vagrant image of your choice.

First, navigate to the MicroShift directory on your host system, or another designated
directory where we will be storing the `Vagrantfile`.

Next, download the vagrant image. For this example we will use
a fedora 34 cloud image:

```sh
vagrant box add fedora/34-cloud-base
```

Depending on the image, Vagrant will ask you to select a Virtualization provider,
just select the first one.

Once that downloads, initialize the repository for launching your image:

```
vagrant init fedora/34-cloud-base
```

Running this command will create a `Vagrantfile` in your working directory which
is used to configure your vagrant box.

Before starting the Vagrant box, increase the amount of RAM available to the system.
To do this, edit the `Vagrantfile` and configure your provider settings to include
the following:

```rb
    config.vm.provider "libvirt" do |v|
        # provides 3GB of memory
        v.memory = 3072
        # for parallelization
        v.cpus = 2
    end
```

The value of `config.vm.provider` depends on the provider you selected when you
ran `vagrant add` earlier. For example, if you selected `virtualbox` then the first
line should be: `config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|`

Now start the VM:

```
vagrant up
```

Once the VM is up, connect to it:

```
vagrant ssh
```

Once ssh'd into the vagrant instance, refer to the [local build and install]({{< ref "/docs/developer-documentation/local-development#build-dependencies" >}}) to begin local development.

### (Extra Optional) Connecting VSCode to Vagrant

If using VSCode, you can connect to your vagrant box with a few extra steps.

#### Increasing Memory Requirements

Since VSCode leans more on the heavy side of development, the RAM usage on your Vagrant environment
can go up to 5GB, and therefore we will need to modify the `Vagrantfile` to
increase the amount of available RAM from 3GB to 5GB (or 6GB if you want to be safe).
To do this, set `v.memory` to the following in your `Vagrantfile`:

```rb
        # provides 5GB of memory
        v.memory = 5120
        # provides 6GB of memory
        v.memory = 6144
```

#### Setting up an SSH Profile

First we need to ask Vagrant for an SSH config file. From your host machine, run:

```
vagrant ssh-config > ssh-config.conf
```

_You can edit the `ssh-config.conf` file to change the hostname from `default` to
`vagrant` to be more easily identifiable, but that's up to you. :)_

Here's an example of a working SSH config file:

```
Host default
  HostName 127.0.0.1
  User vagrant
  Port 2222
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  PasswordAuthentication no
  IdentityFile /path/to/microshift/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  LogLevel FATAL
```

Next, you'll want to install the `Remote - SSH` extension from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)

With the extension installed, you'll click on the green bottom in the bottom-left
corner of VSCode to open a dropdown menu for SSH options:

![VSCode Remote Button](../../../images/vscode-remote-button.png)

Select the option to open an SSH configuration file:
![Dropdown Menu](../../../images/remote-ssh-dropdown.png)

Next you'll want to navigate to the "Remote Explorer" tab on the left-hand side
of VSCode, then select on the vagrant target (default if you haven't renamed it)
and click on the button to connect to it in a remote window.

Now that the vagrant environment is setup, refer to the [local build and install]({{< ref "/docs/developer-documentation/local-development#build-dependencies" >}})
