## Building the MicroShift Containers

Install `podman` if not yet installed:

```Bash
sudo dnf install -y podman
```

Clone the repository and `cd` into it:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/openshift/microshift.git
cd microshift
```

Build the MicroShift image:

```Bash
make microshift
```

Build the MicroShift bundled (All-In-One) image:

```Bash
make microshift-aio
```
## Tagging the Image

After building the MicroShift image, the `podman tag` command can be used to modify the image name to suit your needs. See the example below.

```Bash
IMAGE=$(podman images | grep micro | awk '{print $3}')
podman tag ${IMAGE} quay.io/microshift/microshift:latest
```

## Running the MicroShift Containers

Depending on which image version you built, follow the documentation to run the image.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="MicroShift Containerized" %}}

Follow [Getting Started with MicroShift Containerized]({{< ref "/docs/getting-started/_index.md#launch-microshift-with-podman-and-systemd" >}})    
Substitute the image name:tag in the systemd unit file at `/etc/system/systemd/microshift.service` with the newly built image name:tag.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="MicroShift Bundled Image (All-In-One)" %}}

Follow [Using MicroShift for Application Development]({{< ref "/docs/getting-started/_index.md#using-microshift-for-application-development" >}})    
Substitute the image name:tag in the podman command with the newly built image name:tag.

## Building offline container image rpms

`packaging/rpm/make-microshift-images-rpm.sh` is responsible for extracting the right
MicroShift component container images into an rpm, srpm, or triggering a build in copr.

`make-microshift-images-rpm.sh` queries the MicroShift code via `pkg/release/get.sh` to identify the
MicroShift component images for the release in each architecture, it accepts one parameter with the
desired action (`rpm`, `srpm`, `copr`), being `rpm` the default.

For example:

```bash
cd packaging/rpm
./make-microshift-images-rpm.sh
```

or

```bash
cd packaging/rpm
export COPR_REPO=@redhat-et/microshift-containers
./make-microshift-images-rpm.sh copr
```

Please note that `@redhat-et/microshift-containers` is the default, being `@redhat-et` a group in copr, for a regular user you can user `username/microshift-containers` for example.
