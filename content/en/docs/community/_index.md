## Here's how to get involved

- Join us on [Slack](https://microshift.slack.com)! ([Invite to the Slack space](https://join.slack.com/t/microshift/shared_invite/zt-uxncbjbl-XOjueb1ShNP7xfByDxNaaA))


- The MicroShift team is incredibly grateful for the public interest the project has gained.  As this interest grows, we feel it will be critical to establish a solid community framework that can scale with community involvement.  Because MicroShift is still in its early days and moving quickly, the team's energy will be focused on driving the project towards its techincal goals.  Until such a time that it's decided there is a need for a community framework, please utilize our public slack channel.
