# The MicroShift documentation

This repository contains the assets required to build the [MicroShift website and documentation](https://microshift.io/). We welcome contributions.

## Prerequisites

To use this repository, you need the following installed locally:

**NOTE:**
`make server` command will install hugo-extended binary to the current directory

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Hugo (Extended version)](https://gohugo.io/)

Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redhat-et/microshift-documentation.git
cd microshift-documentation
```

## Running the website locally using Hugo

```bash
npm install
# if you do want to download and use hugo-extended in current directory
make server
# or if you already have hugo-extended installed in $PATH
hugo serve
```

This will start the local Hugo server on port 1313. Open up your browser to <http://localhost:1313> to view the website. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the website and forces a browser refresh.
