# The MicroShift documentation

This repository contains the assets required to build the [MicroShift website and documentation](https://microshift.io/). We welcome contributions.

## Prerequisites

To use this repository, you need the following installed locally:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Hugo (Extended version)](https://gohugo.io/)

Before you start, install the dependencies. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redhat-et/microshift-documentation.git
cd microshift-documentation
```

## Running the website locally using Hugo

Make sure to install the Hugo extended version.

Also, install `PostCSS` for the docs site to create the CSS assets. Install by running the following from the
root directory:

```bash
sudo npm install -D --save autoprefixer
sudo npm install -D --save postcss-cli
sudo npm install
```

To build and test the site locally, run:

```bash
make server
```

This will start the local Hugo server on port 1313. Open up your browser to <http://localhost:1313> to view the website. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the website and forces a browser refresh.
